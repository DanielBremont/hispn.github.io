## The Secret to Time Travel

The objects embody information and imagination may seem obvious.

Knowledge and knowhouw are not the same.

*Knowledge*: involves relationships or linkages between entities. These relationships  are often used to predict the outcomes of events without having to act them out. For instance, we know that tabacco use indreases the likelihood of lung cancer, and we can use that linkage to anticipate the consequences of tobacco use without the need to use tobacco ourselves.

*Knowhow*: involves the capacity to perform actions, which is tacit. For example, most of us know how to walk, even though we do not know how we walk.

The tacit nature of knowhow seems strange, as it makes us feel like automations that are unawaer of what we are doing. Yet there is noting strange in that. As Marvin Minsky, one of the fathers of artificial intelligence, once said: "No computer has ever been designed that is ever aware of what it's doing: but most of the time, we aren't either."

## The Marriage of Knowledge, Knowhow, and Information

*Information* refers  to the order embodied in codified sequences, such as those found in music or DNA, while *knowledge* and *knowhow* refer to the ability  of a system to process information.
