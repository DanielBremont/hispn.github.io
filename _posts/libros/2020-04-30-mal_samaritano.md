## The Lexus and the olive tree revisited

Myths and facts about globalization

History of Toyota and  Toyopet the first car. In a country that was not a car producer.

Some argue that Japan was not ready for a complex industry like a **Car Industry**.

Others disagreed. They argued that no country had got anywhere without developign 'serious' industries like automobile production. They just needed more time to make cars that appealed to everyone.

Neoliberal economics orthodoxy:

- a country needs to privitize state-owned enterprises
- maintain low inflaction
- reduce the size of governmnet bereaucracy
- balance the budged (if not running a surplus)
- liberalize trade
- deregulate foreign investment
- deregulate capital markets
- make the currency convertible
- reduce conrruption and privitize pensions

Si el gobierno Japones hubiera seguido esta receta no habria lexus.

Gustavo Franco, a former president of the Brazilian central bank (1997-99), says, his objective was 'to undo forty years of stupidity' and that only choice was to 'neo-liberal or neo-idiotic'.

1960-1970 was a period of 'Industrial Revolution in the Thrid World'.

- WTO
- IMF

Margaret Thatchet, the British prime minister who spearheaded the neo-liberal counter-revoluction, once famously dismissed her critics saying that 'There is no alternative'. The spirit of this argument -known as TINA (There is No Alternative) -permeates the way globalization is portrayed by the Bad Samaritans.

## The Double life of Daniel Defoe

How did the rich countries become rich?

Daniel Defoe, the author of Robinson Crusoe, goverment spy, businessman, writer.
First spy for Robert Harley, the Tory speaker of the House of Commons.

Daniel Defoe, wrote in 1728, A Plan for English Commerce.

In the book Daniel describes how the Tudor monarchs, specially Henry VII and Elizabeth I, used protectionism, subsidies, distribution of monolopy rights, government-sponsored industrial espionage and other means of government intervention to develop England's woollen manufacturing industry.

As Defoe emphasizes, Henry VII did not have any illusions as to how quickly the English producers could catch up with their sophisticated competitors in the Low Contries. The King raised export duties ono row wool only when the English industry was established enougth to handle the volumne of wool to be processed.

King’s address to Parliament: ‘it is evident that nothing so much contributes to promote the public well-being as the exportation of manufactured goods and the importation of foreign raw matrial’.

In 1820, Britain's average tariff rate on manufacturing imports was 45-55%, compared to 6-8% in the Low Contries, 8-12% in Germany and Switzerland and around 20% in France.

THe manufacturers agitated for the abolition of the Corn Laws that limited the country's ability to import cheap grains. Cheaper food was important to them because it could lower wages and raise profits.

The anti-Corn Law campaign was crucially helped by the economist, politician and stock-market, David Ricardo. Ricardo came up with the theory of comparative advantage that still forms the core of free trade theory.

Ricardo's theory is absolutely - within its narrow confines. His theory correctly says that, acepting their current levels of technology as given, it is better for contries to specialize in things that they are relative better at. One cannot argue with that.

His theory fails when a country wants to acquire more advanced technologies so that it can do more difficult things few others can do - that is, when it wants to develop its economy. It takes time and experience to absorb new technologies, so technologically backwards producers neeed a period of protection from international competition during this period of learning.

But many historinas familiar with the period point out that making food cheaper was only one aim of the anti-Corn Law campaigners. It was also an act of 'free trade imperialism' intented to 'halt the move to industrialisation on the Continent by enlarging the market for agricultural produce and primary materials'.  By opening its domestic agricultural market wider, Britain wanted to lure its competitors back into agriculture. Indeed, the leader of the anti-Corn movement, Richard Cobded, argued that, without the Corn Laws: "The factory system would, in all probability, nto have taken place in America and Germany. It almost certanly could not have flourished, as it has gone, bouth in the stated, and in Frace, Belgium, and Swizerland, through the fostering bounties which high-priced food of the Britsh aritsan ofered to the cheaper fed manufacturer of those contries".  No wonder Friedrich List talked about 'kicking way the ladder'.

Adam Smith, solemnly advised the Americans not to develop manufacturing. He argued that any attempt to 'stop the importation of European manufacturer' would 'obstruct instead of promoting the progress of their contry towaards real wealth and greatness'.

Alexander Hamilton disagred with these view. He develop the strategy of 'infant industries'.

## My six-year-old- son should get a job

Is free trade always the answer?

Cuando tenemos un ninio lo protejemos, e invertimos en su educacion, cuando podria trabajar y ganarse la vida. De cual de las dos formas podria ser el ninio mas productivo en el largo plazo.

The story of Mexico - poster boy of the free-trade camp is particular telling. If any developing contry can succeed with free trade, it should be Mexico.

Modern free trade argument is based on the so-called Heckscker-Ohlin-Samuelson theory (or the HOS theory). The HOS theory derives from David Ricardo's theory. It assumes that comparative advantage arises from international differences in the relative endowment of 'factors of production' (capital and labour), rather than international differences in technology, ad in Ricardian theory.

According to free trade theory, every country has a comparative advantage in some products, as it is, by definition, relatively  better at producing some things than others.

## The finn and the elephant

Should we regulate foreign investment?

The Finns like to tell a joke about themselves. What would a German, a Frecnhman, an American and a Finn do if they were asked to write a book on the elephant?

- *The German*, with his characteristic throughness, would write a thick two-volume, fully annotated study entitled, Everything That There is to Know About the Elephant.
- *The Frechman*, with his penchant for philosophical musings and existential anguish, whould write a book entitled 'The Life and Philosophy of the Elephant'
- *The American*, with his famous nose for good business opportunities, would naturally write a book entitled, 'How to Make monery with an elephant'
- The finn would write a book entitled 'What Does the Elepahnt Think of the Finns?'

Finnland introduced a series of laws in the 1930s that officially classified all the enterprises with more than 20% foreign ownership as – hold your breath – ‘dangerous’.

The law was relaxaed in 1987, and the number was rise up to 40%.
In 1995 as Finnland enter the EU the law as more leberalise.

Si la inversion extranjera destruye industrias nativas, con potencial, puede ser mala inversion.

The USA bad record of foreign investment.

Most of today’s rich countries regulated foreign investment when they were on the receiving end.

Short term grow vs long term grow.

## Man exploits man

Private enterprise good, public enterprise bad?

**Why not public interprise?**

- The idea is that people do not fully take care of things that are not theirs.

En teoria las empresas publicas son de todos, y si un ciudadano se toma la molestia de aumentar la eficiencia de la empresa por medios de monitorizacion, habra gastando tiempo y energia, y los beneficios se repartiran entre todos los ciudadanos.

Luego cual es el incentivo para ese ciudadano privado.

Pero los estados incluso los desarollados, hacen muchos rescates a empresas e incluso la convierten en empresas estatales.

La historia de POSCO.

Taiwan's official economic idiology is the so-called 'Three People's Principles'. These principles dictate that key industries should be own by the state.

### The case for state ownership

When the private-sector investors refuse to finance a venture despite its long-term viability because they think it is too risky. Capital markets have an inherent bias towards short-term gains and do not like risky, large-scale projects with long gestation periods.

Prussia set up a number of 'model factories' like (linen above all), metals, armaments, porcelain, silk and sugar refining. Meji Japon emulate Prussia.

State-owned enterprises can also be ideal where there exists 'natural monopoly'. Ej. Electricity, water, gas, railways, etc.

Is it wrong to 'borrow' ideas?

If patents collide with public interest, what happends? Medecine, HIV-AIDS.

Patent are only one means for promoting discovery and invention. Scientific curiosity, has been of far greater importance throughout history.

Most industries actually do not need patents and other IPRs to generate new knowledge – although they will be more than happy to take advantage of them, if they are offered to them. The patent lobby talks nonsense when it argues that there will be no new technological progress without patents.

John Law recuitred hundreds of skilled workers from Britain in an attempt to upgrade France's technology.

Means to copy british tech:

- The ‘legal’ means included apprenticeships and factory tours.
- The ‘illegal’ means involved the governments of continental Europe and the US luring skilled workers contrary to British law.
- 'Illegal'  Machines smuggling and industrial spionage

The first patent system is supposes to have been used by Venice in 1474, when it granted ten years 'privileges to inventors of' new args and machines.

Disembodied knowledge.

Chemical substances remained unpatentable in Switzerland until 1978.

When the pantent laws can became an obstacle, to technological innovation.

## Mission impossible

Can financial prudence go too fat?

Keynes argued that what is rational for individual actors may not be rational for the entire economy.

The goverment has to have a balanced budged but not neceserally every year, but in business cycles.

Gore Vidal, 'free entreprise for the poor and sociliasm for the rich'.

## Zaire vs Indonesia

Should we turn our backs on corrupt and undemocratic contries?

Example of Indonesia more corrupt than Zaire but improve more than Zaire the quality of life of the citizetns.

In Zaire must of the corrupt money was shipped out of the country. But in Indonesia the money mostly stay in the contry.

## Lazy Japanese and thieving

Germans Are some cultures incapable of economic development?

In his 1903 book, Evolution of the Japonese, the American missionary Sidney Gullick observed that many Japonese 'give an impression .. of being lazy and utterly indifferent to the passage of time'. Gullick lives in Japon for 25 years.

Acountry contains many cultural groups, specially in big ones like China or India.

Confucianism was used to explain both development and under-development of asia.
