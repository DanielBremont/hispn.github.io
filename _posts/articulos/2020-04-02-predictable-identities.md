## Guess What’s Coming

Can you predict the last word in this sentience? It’s not “sentence”. The last word in sentience research is that most of what our brains do is try and predict the signals they’re about to receive, like the words you read on a page. Prediction shapes our perception, which is why that word appeared as “sentence” the first time you read it.

Our brains implement predictive models at multiple levels, from general worldviews to detailed patterns. When reading a text, your brain starts predicting the language and theme based on its model of the publication. This drives the prediction of sentences based on a model of grammar, prediction of how words should be spelled, and finally a detailed prediction of how characters should display.

Consider:

1. This looks weird.
2. This looks wiedr.
3. Looks weird this.
4. Your mom looks weird.

Our brains optimize for predicting incoming signals over our entire lifetime. This is achieved in two ways: doing a good job of predicting inputs right now, and learning new models that will allow us to make great predictions in the future. Does reading the post so far feel unpleasantly confusing? That’s because the content was too unpredictable, and contradicted too many of your existing models of how brains work. Did it feel awesomely mind-blowing? That’s the joy of acquiring a new model that offers a condensed explanation of what you already know, and thus a promise of better predictions to come.

In either case, you should learn more about the predictive processing paradigm of cognition from [this series of articles](http://philosophyofbrains.com/author/clarka) or [this book review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/); this blogchain is mostly done covering the established science. Instead, we’re going to forge forward irresponsibly and use predictive processing to explain political polarization, identity, war, and adjunct professorship.

Do you think you know what’s coming?

<div id="2"> </div>

## Active Inference

One sentence recap of [Part I](#1): our brains are constantly trying to make true predictions about the world. We do it in two ways:

1. Assembling good models that make accurate predictions.
2. Changing the world to match our predictions.

When Apple released a buggy version of Maps, The Onion joked that [“Apple is fixing glitches in Maps by rearranging Earth’s geography”](https://www.theonion.com/apple-promises-to-fix-glitches-in-map-software-by-rearr-1819595356). That’s exactly what our brains do.

Actions are driven by predictions propagating across different levels. We shoot a basketball by forecasting the flight of the ball, which leads to predicting that we will lift the ball and push it, culminating in precise anticipations of the required tension in the arm muscles. We are satisfied when the ball flies according to our projection and upset when it doesn’t

That’s why predicting well is so important to our evolved brains – when we predict well we know how to act to achieve our goals. A predictable environment is an exploitable environment.

Of course, basketballs are not a big component of our milieu, and our ability to predict them isn’t crucial. What is vital for us to model above all else are people, from faraway strangers to neighbors and friends. Also ourselves: prediction happens at different parts of the brain simultaneously, and each module has to predict what the others would do, now and in the future.

Predictive processing expert Sun Tzu observed:

> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

We observe other minds, interrogate them, and push them to conform to our models of them as best we can – all to maximize our predictive power and capacity to act effectively. This is a powerful lens through which to observe how we interact with others, and how we build our own predictable identities.

<div id="3"> </div>

## Prisoner’s Dilemma


Much of human interaction is shaped by [the structure of the prisoner’s dilemma](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/29/winning-is-for-losers/). We put in place institutions and norms to enforce cooperation. [We tell shared stories](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/) to inspire it. [We evolved moral emotions](http://www.joshua-greene.net/moral-tribes) to achieve cooperation on an interpersonal level: empathy and gratitude to assure cooperators of our cooperation, anger and vengefulness to punish defectors, tribalism and loyalty to cooperate with those we know well.

But the crux of the prisoner’s dilemma is that defection is always better for the defector. We try to get others to cooperate with us, [but we also try to defect](https://www.wired.com/2009/02/ted-1/) as much as we can get away with. We want our peers to pay their taxes, admit mistakes, share credit, and stay faithful. We also fudge our taxes, shift blame, boast, and cheat.

There are many strategies for dealing with PD, and some of them can be formalized in code and [entered in competitions](https://ncase.me/trust/) with other strategies. The simple strategies are named and studied: tit-for-tat responds to each play in kind, tit-for-two-tats forgives one deception in case it was a mistake, [Pavlov changes tacks](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/the-pavlov-strategy/) after being defected against and so on and so forth. Which strategy works best?

It turns out that the success of each strategy [depends almost entirely](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/11/15/the-darwin-game/) on the strategies played by opponents. Each approach can fail to reach cooperation with others or under-exploit opportunities to defect; even a strategy of always defecting is optimal if enough other players always cooperate. If you only knew what your opponent is playing, you could always choose the best option.

And this brings us back to predicting other humans. If we can model their strategies, if we know who will be forgiving and kind, who will be vengeful and dangerous, we can play optimally in any situation. Predicting well is the unbeatable strategy.

## Stereotypes

How do we predict strangers?

Humans evolved in an environment where they rarely had to do this. Practically everyone a prehistoric human met was familiar and could be modeled individually based on their past interactions. But today, we deal with ever-stranger strangers on big city streets, in global markets, online…

We need to make quick predictions about people we’ve never met. We do it using stereotypes.

[Early research on stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Prejudice) focused on their affective aspect: we dislike strangers, but less so as we get to know them. But new studies have looked at the content of stereotypes, [finding that groups are judged independently](https://cos.gatech.edu/facultyres/Diversity_Studies/Fiske_StereotypeContent.pdf) on the dimensions of warmth/competitiveness and status/competence. For example, Germans see Italians as high-warmth low-competence, i.e. lovable buffoons; Italians see Germans as the exact opposite, i.e. mercenary experts.

These dimensions are primarily about predicting someone’s behavior and capability. In [game theory](#3) terms: Will that person cooperate? And can I safely defect on them or do I have to play nice?

Contrary to the well-meaning wishes of most stereotype researchers, there is robust empirical evidence on [stereotype accuracy](http://www.spsp.org/news-center/blog/stereotype-accuracy-response). The short of it is that people’s stereotypes are, in fact, quite accurate, especially stereotypes of gender and ethnicity. Whether stereotyping is good or bad, it cannot simply be wished “educated” away. It is universal because it’s very useful for prediction.

A smart person noted that problems arise from having too few stereotypes, not too many. If you have a single stereotype for “Jews” you’re doing a bad job of modeling Jewish people, and are likelier to mistreat them due to prejudice. If you have separate stereotypes for Hasidic Jews, Brooklyn conservative Zionists, liberal Jewish atheists, secular Israelis etc. you’re one step closer to treating (and modeling) unfamiliar Jews as individuals. [Studying cultures](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/product/compare-countries/) is about acquiring many useful stereotypes.

<div id="5"> </div>

## Outgroup Homogeneity

There are more ways for someone to be different from you than to be similar. But psychologically, it works the other way around. We perceive those like us as uniquely distinct and the outgroup as undifferentiated. It’s called the [outgroup homogeneity effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-group_homogeneity).

This effect extends to physical appearance (e.g. faces of other ethnicities looking the same) and mental traits (e.g. people of the other gender all supposedly wanting the same things). Surprisingly, the effect is [unrelated to the number](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-group_homogeneity#Explanations) of ingroup and outgroup members one knows; it’s not about mere exposure.

[I recently wrote](https://putanumonit.com/2018/09/27/what-the-haters-hate/) about a remarkable case of the outgroup homogeneity effect: [Ezra Klein’s strange attempt](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/24/17883330/dave-rubin-ben-shapiro-youtube-reactionary-right-peterson) to make the case that liberaltarian podcaster (and Klein’s co-ethnic) Dave Rubin is a reactionary.

Klein starts by looking at [the network graph](https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/youtube-right-network-graph.png) of podcast appearances which links Rubin to several unsavory reactionaries. But Klein himself is just two podcasts removed from Richard Spencer, so that’s not great. He then defines “reactionaries” narrowly as those who seek “a return to traditional gender and racial norms”. Of course, most of Rubin’s flagship positions (gay marriage, drug legalization, abortion access, prison reform, abolishing the death penalty) have to do with gender and race norms. Specifically: changing them.

I think what happened is that Ezra Klein picked up intuitively on the one important similarity between Rubin and conservative reactionaries: they both strongly dislike him.

People legislate the distinction [between pies and tarts](https://twitter.com/CrimeADay/status/1106359150777454592?s=19) and between plums and nectarines, but only geologists care about telling apart inedible rocks. Same with people: it’s important to keep track individually of [potential cooperators](#3), reciprocity relationships, etc. But once you model someone as a defector, you don’t need more detail to predict that they’ll defect. The outgroup is good for writing snarky articles about. For this, you don’t have to tell them apart.


<div id="6"> </div>

## Creeps

We’ve looked at predicting people from a distance: [employing stereotypes](#4) and [homogenizing outgroups](#5). Moving a step closer to the self, consider an individual you have just met. What are you looking for in the first few minutes of interaction? Among other things, often first among them, is predictability.

A member of your tribe is highly predictable. If you share a taste in clothes and podcasts you can predict with high confidence how they’ll react in social situations, what their habits and motivations are, etc. That’s why small talk about last night’s episode of Game of Thrones isn’t a waste of time. It communicates: I am like you, you can model me well by looking at yourself, we can cooperate.

Second best is someone who fits well in a group stereotype, even if that’s not your ingroup. You may not befriend many middle-aged bearded men who speak a language you can’t recognize, but you feel comfortable getting in a taxi with one.

Now consider someone who looks like you, watches the same shows, and also eats spiders they catch around the house. Would you get in a taxi with them?

The opposite of predictability is creepiness. In the leading [research paper on the nature of creepiness](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2016.03.003), the author describes it:

> The perception of creepiness is a response to the ambiguity of threat. […] While they may not be overtly threatening, individuals who display unusual patterns of nonverbal behavior, odd emotional responses or highly distinctive physical characteristics are outside the norm, and by definition unpredictable.

Eating spiders by itself doesn’t make one dangerous, but it’s a signal that this person can’t be predicted well by pattern matching to stereotypes or by self-modeling (unless you’re an arachnophage yourself). We react to creepiness not with fear but with aversion. We dislike what we cannot predict.

<div id="7"> </div>

## Weirdness Budget

Social life needs predictable people who conform to expectations. There are common expectations which apply to every person in the group, and personal expectations based on one’s perceived role and past behavior.

Deviating from common expectations costs [idiosyncrasy credits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncrasy_credit). Dressing differently, eating strange diets, watching documentaries that no one else does and not watching the show everyone talks about – these all exhaust a limited budget of nonconformity. The budget accrues to people who conform or are popular; the two often go hand in hand.

As [Homer Simpson](https://deadhomersociety.com/2011/06/16/quote-of-the-day-821/) noted: “Marge, I can’t wear a pink shirt to work, everybody wears white shirts. I’m not popular enough to be different.”

When someone exceeds their idiosyncrasy budget, their opinions will get dismissed on grounds of [absurdity bias](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Absurdity_heuristic) and the [horn effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_effect). If you want to tell your [millennial]() friends about [crazy ideas like unfriendly AI](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wkuDgmpxwbu2M2k3w/you-have-a-set-amount-of-weirdness-points-spend-them-wisely) or Ribbonfarm, make sure you are otherwise appropriate.

Personal expectations include [playing out roles](#8) and simply being the same person over time. Even changes of mind that don’t violate group norms, like hating a movie that you liked last year, can be grating. If you’re not changing in ways that are fun for your friends, you’re just making yourself hard to model and get along with.

Imagine a conversation with just a few people. When deciding whether to tell a joke, you have to consider your friends’ likely reactions to the joke. But you also have to consider [their reaction to everyone else’s reaction](https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/common-knowledge-and-miasma-20d0076f9c8e), and what it implies about everyone’s relationships and status, and so on down [many layers of metacognition](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4eDzqS2rbcBDsCLZ/unrolling-social-metacognition-three-levels-of-meta-are-not). If you can’t rely on heuristics of shared group expectations and consistency over time, the computational effort is overwhelming. You’re likelier than not to go look for a more predictable group of friends to joke with.

<div id="8"> </div>

## Roles People Play

We [fit strangers in stereotypes](#4), and we like strangers [who fit our stereotypes](#6) and act congruently. Dealing with people we know allows for more personalized modeling, but we still want associates and companions to stick to their roles.

Most everyone in most every office resembles a character on The Office, not just in the broad strokes of the [Gervais Principle](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/) but down to details of job, dress, and personality. Husbands and wives have played out “if it weren’t for you” patterns long before [Games People Play](http://www.ericberne.com/games-people-play/) described them.

The main difference from predicting strangers is that dealing with familiar people allows for active inference: enforcing others’ conformity to prediction. Valentine Smith describes this in his excellent essay The [Intelligent Social Web]():

> You move away [from your family] and make new friends and become a new person […] But then you visit your parents, and suddenly you feel and act a lot like you did before you moved away. You might even try to hold onto this “new you” with them… and they might respond to what they see as strange behavior by trying to nudge you into acting “normal”: ignoring surprising things you say, changing the topic to something familiar, starting an old fight, etc.

This nudging is effected by thousands of small actions perpetrated by dozens of people. We receive small negative reinforcements when we do something unpredictable that causes others’ models to momentarily fail, and positive rewards when we conform to our roles. The social life of an office or a family is too complex to compute without stable roles assigned to people, the same way a brain can’t cohere a visual scene without the expectation that visual objects remain stable.

Life in the social web means that growth and change are harder than they appear. Hard, but not impossible.


<div id="9"> </div>

## How to Change

You’ve changed your mind and who you want to be. Your social web [is having none of it](#8). What to do?

One option is to simply power through. Stick to your (new) guns and admit that your mind is indeed changed. The [“zeal of the convert”](https://www.pewforum.org/2009/10/28/the-zeal-of-the-convert-is-it-the-real-deal/) is important here: it takes extra commitment to convince those who knew the old you to change their story.

A savvier approach is to leverage common tropes and adopt a role that entails transformation. If you want to switch from layabout to responsible professional, or vice versa from workaholic to self-caretaker, it may help to have a romantic partner break up with you. “Area person reassesses life priorities after heartbreak” is a familiar story that people can get behind. “Area rationalist reassesses life after [Hamming circle](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P5k3PGzebd5yYrYqd/the-hamming-question)” isn’t, even if that’s what actually happened.

But the easiest option may just be to GTFO and change the scene. I’ve reset my social web several times, usually with positive results.

By the time I learned how to be funny in elementary school, everyone had decided that I’m a boring nerd. I moved to a new city for high school and did better as the clever class clown, but these traits were not in high demand when I enlisted in the military. I eventually grokked professionalism, but it was too late to gain the trust of my officers. I emigrated. I did better in my next two stops but blew through my [weirdness budgets](#7) and couldn’t shake off my reputation as a weirdo.

Finally, I came to New York, where I did not know a single soul. I took my craziest opinions out of the office and [onto the internet](https://putanumonit.com/). I started acting like the person I wanted to be seen as, not who I was before.

It works, for now.

<div id="10"> </div>

## Big Updates

When the world conforms better to your expectations, whether through effective action or improving models, it feels great. When the world slides towards unpredictability, it sucks. So how does changing your mind feel? That depends on whether the change improves or breaks your predictions.

Look at the image below until you can make out what it is.

![Alternativo](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fQy444eqgiIP8QhA9HNYh6q8r7FGbGJ_0yggAU22NZPPAVhW8dUm7Kxd_-d03rFTJph45_ENBWAHktCKdd3KdqE7UR6lMIMGVJl-szT7tD4-px4ka48oFQpiyBsSsWBgXHuzayTq "Logo 1")

[Got it?](http://psych-pstuff.blogspot.com/2012/02/can-you-see-cow.html) The moment when the picture resolves feels good because it resolves into something familiar. Random blobs are unpredictable, but you know what a cow looks like and what to expect of it.

How about this one?

![7 things every kid needs to hear](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vhXNmSC85QnYJonlKfofVv_vXi6WpdIZ0Jj2upGWTflnuJsL2lOSX9G8FUC0oCvXXnPYhchoKUqTjPy2tf5VQzI0uJWt7tZMZChKCuiNC-loKFslZO9dBhQWFkbf4zskLLsXZ-Se "7 things every kid needs to hear")


Changing your mind about communism is much harder than about a picture of a cow. Whatever your current view of communism, it is a high-level model with multiple associations. It impacts many concrete predictions about nations, politics, your life and career choices, and what sort of person you will get along ([i.e., cooperate](#3)) with: the Ethiopian lady picking the coffee or the Londoner consultant dude drinking it.

Updating a high-level model is a risky undertaking because it immediately breaks all the predictions that depend on it. You must have an entire alternative system of smaller beliefs and connections in place that fit the new model – then it feels like an epiphany or a long-needed [paradigm shift](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/08/book-review-the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions/). To convert someone to atheism, it is better first to convince them that atheism doesn’t necessitate immorality or a belief in [transforming monkeys](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/atcJqdhCxTZiJSxo2/talking-snakes-a-cautionary-tale).

<div id="11"> </div>

## Fear, Myths and the Outgroup, Part I

The first reason why I like the article [Neuropsychology of Motivation for Group Aggression and Mythology](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/docs/230/2014/26Petersonmythology.pdf) is that it does what [this blogchain hopes to](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/20/predictable-identities-1/), using predictive processing to explain at once rat behavior, ancient religious symbols, and war crimes.

It starts by noting that fear and anxiety are not emotions that animals need to learn, but are the default reaction to any novel situation. A rat placed in a new cage will first freeze in fear, then sniff and look around cautiously, and only later will dare to move about and explore.

> “[T]he organism is only calm, habituated, free of stress, and well-adapted when cortical [predictions, plans, desires] and brainstem [sensory information from the outside] input match.”

This applies to physical space, and even more so to the social environment. We react negatively to familiar people who break social norms and to “strangers, [who] offer equivalent threat. No one knows where they fit, what they think, or what they are likely to do. Thus, they threaten the integrity of the social and psychological structures that inhibit fear.” The symbol of the chaotic unknown in many ancient traditions is a reptile – unpredictable people literally [creep us out](#6).

We’re not fans of ideas that challenge our [high-level models](#10) either. According to psychologist [George Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kelly_(psychologist)): “. . . a major revision of one’s construct system can threaten with immediate change, or chaos, or anxiety.” Often, people will either willfully ignore challenging data or force it to conform to their pre-existing narrative, what Kelly calls “confirmation extortion”.

One such challenge is admitting that a person we’ve dismissed as an enemy of our tribe or a buffoon who is safe to ignore, may actually have good ideas. And this brings me to the second reason I like this article – but more on that in the next post.

<div id="12"> </div>

## Fear, Myths and the Outgroup, Part 2

In [Neuropsychology of Group Aggression](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/docs/230/2014/26Petersonmythology.pdf) Jordan Peterson, before anyone knew or hated him, inadvertently describes why some people will passionately hate him when they find out.

The article talks about high-level models keeping anxiety and fear of the unknown at bay. When [these models are challenged](#10) [these models are challenged] by new data, people whose frameworks are already straining will react to the challenge with hostility. They will engage in [“confirmation extortion”](#11) and attack the messenger.

> […] the tendency to demonize evidence of conceptual insufficiency, or the bearers of that evidence, and to ‘morally’ attempt to eliminate it or them from existence.

Making a distinction between “reporters” and “journalists”, the latter’s job is not to describe facts but to interpret their meaning. Meaning-making involves applying stock narratives, the primary one often being “the outgroup is evil and [all the same](#5)”. For journalists whose outgroup are conservatives, Peterson highlights the acute “conceptual insufficiency” of that narrative.

Conservatives are not supposed to be humanities professors at Harvard, but Peterson was. Conservatives are supposed to say that life begins at conception, but Peterson’s takes [a full minute to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5k9EDgY8UM&vl=en) of what to say on abortion, and five more to say it.

In his most notorious interview, journalist Cathy Newman repeats [“so you’re saying…”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-rE03PGQfA) dozens of times as she tries to cram Peterson’s idiosyncratic worldview into a familiar narrative – quintessential confirmation extortion. When he’s not around to interview, journalists often engage in “moral elimination” by associating him with [the worst of his fans](https://medium.com/the-future-is-electric/why-jordan-b-peterson-is-a-favorite-of-the-alt-right-21f6339b3ef).

Why not attack the worst of his arguments instead? I think it has less to do with the strength of Peterson’s arguments and more with the journalists’ own anxiety. The financial anxiety of a struggling industry, the status anxiety of alternative outlets stealing attention, and the ideological anxiety of their narratives failing in the face of a [weirding world](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/weirding-diary/) full of weird people like Jordan Peterson.

<div id="13"> </div>

## Totalizing Ideologies

One last quote from [Peterson’s article](#11):

> “Totalitarian refusal to develop new skill and new modes of conceptualization when confronted with error makes life increasingly miserable.”
Who’s to blame for the misery inflicted by inflexible worldviews? The fault lies both in ourselves and in our memes.

The subconscious models in our brains know to stick to their limited domains. We have a model of how to catch balls, and the first time we apply it to a Frisbee it fails utterly. Our brains aren’t stubborn and quickly develop a new model of how discs fly.

But higher-level conscious models endeavor to become absolute and all-embracing. Religions are ostensibly about the divine, and yet rabbis must opine on every topic from eating your own snot [(not kosher)](https://weirdjews2.livejournal.com/616507.html?thread=9985851#t9985851) to jaywalking [(kosher)](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3703448/jewish/Does-Judaism-Allow-Jaywalking-or-Speeding.htm). Political ideologies, whether progressive, conservative, [or libertarian](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/libertarian-principles-climate-change/), end up providing answers to matters of pure science like climate change projections. And every philosophy answers the most important question: who’s with us (those who share the belief) and who’s against. 

Peterson himself is guilty of the cardinal sin of all philosophers — never refusing to pass judgment on a person or topic.

Philosophies evolve towards becoming totalizing ideologies by natural selection. A philosophy (or guru) that leave room for unanswered questions invite competition and will find themselves displaced by more totalizing rivals. After all, it is easier to remember a single ideology than many — or to watch a single YouTube channel.

[A single meaning-making ideology](https://meaningness.com/preview-eternalism-and-nihilism#eternalism) is comforting, pleasant, and seductive. It provides easy answers as long as one doesn’t think too hard and keeps ignoring the discrepancies. But as the errors pile up, [the ideology fights back](https://meaningness.com/eternalism-considered-harmful), convincing the wavering believer that they are at fault for doubting the cosmic plan. Ideologies don’t disperse gently, they crumble in an avalanche of pain, fear, and confusion.

<div id="14"> </div>

## Frameworks are Fake

very rich-enough belief system [wants to be the single source of answers](#13) to all questions. To fight against that it’s important to remember that every belief system is fake.

The first step is to notice that every single thing can be described using different frameworks, the way a single plot of land is represented using different maps.

![Image](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/F5CkNVVBFterr36EjcPZp146CwcgZYME3knyH_NlpkwL-31gz5UoMmIAp9V5fTP51aW06hdDXQKFXZVqVPFZPZcHA2Yu8Gl26kn8xwvmds--_JTKKC1LEgyvXWEQKklUqSS4qcNu "Image")

Which of these two maps of Princeton is more “true”? Neither, since neither one is actually the town of Princeton itself. They each contain different elements: one has trees and roofs, the other has streets and parks. Certainly, Princeton contains all the above, and many things besides.

If you visit Princeton, you would notice other things it’s made of that don’t show up in the maps, things like people and pizza and noise. But those are also mere “maps” that your brain projects on the town, maps that miss a lot of detail. For example, you miss the fact that both the trees and the pizza are made mostly of carbon atoms. And if you think that “carbon atoms” are a real thing that exists you are at least a century behind on physics.

The fact that frameworks made of cities or trees or carbon atoms are fake doesn’t mean that they’re not useful. Your brain can only predict the world using concepts like “pizza” and “person”, fake though they are. But remembering that all frameworks are fake allows you to nimbly shift among them instead of believing that any single framework contains the only thing reality is really made of. Your brain won’t like this juggling effort at first, but it will appreciate not slamming into massive prediction errors caused by the limitations of a single ontology.

And if “pizza” is fake, how much flimsier are maps made of concepts like “conservative”, “chaos”, “female”, “sin”, “petit-bourgeoisie”, “freedom”, or “privilege”?

## Newcomblike, Part I

“Do you like money?”

You spin around to see a strange child. You could’ve sworn you were alone on this street just a second ago. “Everyone likes money, kid,” you reply, “but I’m not getting sucked into another MLM scheme.” 

“This isn’t MLM, it’s [LDT!](https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5kv)” The child presses an envelope into your hand. “Open it.”

You do, it contains several $100 bills. “What’s the trick?” you ask. “And what’s your name?”

“The name’s [Newcomb](http://mindingourway.com/intro-to-newcomblike-problems/), and the trick was hacking into your phone last month.” The child smiles. “I’ve studied your behavior, and made some predictions. Specifically, I predicted whether you will take the envelope or leave the bills on the ground and go straight home after you hear me speak. If I predicted you would do the latter, I deposited $1,000,000 into your bank account 5 minutes ago. If I predicted you’ll take the cash, I retweeted Trump from your Twitter handle. By the way, I’ve been playing this game for a while and never got a prediction wrong. Goodbye!”

You look down at the cash. “Wait, what if…” but as you look up, the child is gone like an expired snap.

Do you take the cash or leave it and go home? Or do you hate philosophical thought experiments? Alright, let’s talk about something completely different.

Your employer decides on bonuses in December, but the bonuses are only paid out (and found out) in March. If the company predicted that you would slack off in Q1, your bonus is small, and if they thought you’d hustle it’s generous. You planned to quit at the end of March anyway, how hard do you work until then?

A leasing agent says she has another application for your dream apartment, but she’ll let you rent it because she feels you’ll work extra hard to maintain the furnishings. Do you?

## Newcomblike, Part 2

[A super-predictor millionaire child](#15) may seem like a fanciful example, but the general principle of Newcomb’s problem applies to almost every social interaction. People do nice things for you if they predict you are trustworthy, and the only way to be predicted as trustworthy is to be so: leave the cash, work hard, maintain the apartment.

Why not just deceive people? Lying is hard. People put significant cognitive resources into reading your mind, from processing your uncontrollable microexpressions to explicitly simulating your behavior. They also do so as a group, sharing information about your reputation. Conscious deception requires keeping track of two separate stories about your intentions. This imposes an extra cognitive burden when you are already facing a lot of combined brainpower that’s trying to predict you.

One way to lessen the effort of deception is to keep track of only one version — the wrong one. Self-deception is indispensable in social situations, believing yourself to be smarter, better informed, more talented and moral than you really are so that other people treat you as a smart, informed, talented and moral. But for self-deception to successfully affect people’s predictions about you, it must not leak into your conscious awareness. You must sincerely believe you will leave the cash on the ground at least until the child disappears.

If you make it too hard for people to predict you well, you will not be presented with Newcomblike opportunities in the first place. The child wouldn’t offer you money if they couldn’t hack your phone to study you. You won’t get the job offer if you refuse to drink at the networking event and “get to know each other”. The reason I write personal things on the internet every week is to make it easy for faraway strangers to predict my thoughts and values, and to occasionally offer me nice things.

## Midpoint Review

[Predictable Identities](#1) is 16 posts in, which is going much better than I would’ve predicted. It’s time to review what we covered so far: the principles of predictive processing and how we apply them to other people.

Our brains constantly [predict sensory inputs using a hierarchy of models](#1). Learning new and better models improves our predictive ability in the long term but can be [so painful in the short term](#10) that [we will fight against updating](#11), and often [fight the people who force us to update](#12). It’s important to take [all models](#14) with a grain of salt and resist the lure of [all-explaining ideologies](#13).

We predict the world [to exploit and act on it](#2), and the same applies to other people. We need to know how to get people [to do nice things for us](), using [stereotypes for strangers we don’t know](#3) and more [detailed mind-simulations](#15) for people we do. We don’t need detailed models [for people unlikely to be nice](#5) no matter what, and [we’re creeped out](#6) by people who don’t fit our models at all like those who [blow their non-conformity budget](#7). We [encourage those around us to conform](#8) to our narratives and predictions of them, which means that [changing one’s opinions and behavior](#9) takes great effort in the face of the expectations of your social surroundings.

Finally, our predictions of ourselves interplay in complex ways with how others see us, since our minds are neither transparent to us nor opaque to those around us. For example, to be treated nicely [we must honestly believe that we are nice](#16), even if that is self-deceiving. Our models, predictions, and beliefs about our selves form our identities. This will be the topic for the second half of this blogchain.

Thanks for joining me on this journey, I predict exciting things ahead.

<div id="18"> </div>

## Self-consistency

We like and reward people who are consistent, categorizable, and cooperative because it’s easier to predict them. And since prediction shapes action shapes reality, we make other people be so. This was [the first half of this blogchain](#17); the second will cover how we do this to ourselves.

Let’s start with consistency. Students who did well on an exam said that they weren’t anxious before it, those who did poorly said that they were. Pre-exam questionnaires, however, [show that these memories are false](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/014616702237577). We tell ourselves (and our friends) how we immediately fell in love with our partner, even if in reality the first couple of dates were awkward and skeptical. We tell anecdotes about things we did as kids that predict our current vocation, even though at age 6 we were mostly obsessed with spiders and the Power Rangers. We also predict that our attitudes will persist into the future to a much greater extent than they actually do.

Self-consistency bias affects not only our memories, but also [the decisions we make](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180523133210.htm). In fact, we couldn’t make decisions at all without assuming some consistency in our preferences and abilities. And by convincing ourselves of our consistency, we reassure others as well. 

I’m writing this post because I predict that, at least for several more months, I will be as obsessed with identity and predictive processing as I am right now. You’re reading this blogchain partly for the same reason  — you predict that new posts will keep coming every other(ish) Wednesday and will stay on topic. If I actually analyzed the half-life of my fascinations with esoteric topics, I may discover some discouraging patterns. It’s better for all of us that I don’t. 

I have always been writing *Predictable Identities*.

I will always be writing *Predictable Identities*.

Isn’t that reassuring?

<div id="19"> </div>

## Labels

After [consistency](#18), the most important feature of predictable identities is a good label, a pithy description that tells others (and yourself) what to expect of you. 

Let’s say that you are consistent in the sentiment that individuals should be free from government intervention, and thus oppose business regulation and gun control. What should your position be on abortion, immigration, or campaign finance? It’s difficult to extrapolate a coherent position from your basic values, and often not worth the effort  — your take on campaign finance likely has zero impact either on government legislation or on your own life. It’s uncomfortable for your political stances to be so unpredictable.

On the other hand, you may simply adopt the label of “Republican” and acquire a set of stances on all political issues. The Republican position on anything is common knowledge, and anyone who knows that this label is part of your identity should not expect any surprises. Sticking to the label is often valued much more than consistency of actual opinion:

![Net-favorability of Vladimir Putin](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/favorability-putin.jpg "Net-favorability of Vladimir Putin")

People strongly dislike labels that don’t actually help prediction, as illustrated quite hilariously by the recent backlash to “sapiosexual”. From what I can tell, here’s what people who call themselves that mean by it:

- 10% are sexually aroused purely by intelligence, not appearance (yes, they exist).
- 20% like hot people but only if they’re smart.
- 30% weigh personality more than physical attributes in romantic partners, relative to others.
- 40% use the term merely to signal their own intelligence.
- 1 person ([me](https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1094971700561756162)) insists that it should mean “attracted exclusively to Homo sapiens”.

The end result is that people who haven’t met a single self-identified sapiosexual write articles titled [You’re Not Sapiosexual](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/mark-ronson-sapiosexual-or-just-annoying), [You’re Just Annoying](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/mark-ronson-sapiosexual-or-just-annoying) in their frustration at the unpredictability of the label.

Self-labeling is a powerful tool for shaping your behavior and the reactions of others, to be used with care.

<div id="20"> </div>

## Self and Other Labeling

The [last post](#19) set up the motivations and trade-offs of applying identity labels to yourself and to others. One can choose to oppose this ubiquitous labeling or indulge in it. With these two axes, we can sketch out the blogchain’s first (though inevitable) 2×2:

![Identity labels ...](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/label-2x2-1024x805.png "Identity labels ...")


The anti-label corner is exemplified by [Paul Graham’s famous exhortation](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) to keep your identity small and [Scott Alexander’s reminder](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/) that categories are just (occasionally) useful abstractions. This corner sees other-labeling as a distraction from more pertinent questions of what someone actually does or believes; they see self-labeling as a sacrifice of clear thinking for tribal conformity. “Nerd” is a bad label for this corner, but being resistant to labels is its very nature.

Identity politickers sit at the top right corner. They reinforce the centrality of identity built by stacking labels (intersectionality) and demand that others be loyal to their identity markers, as in the quote about black faces and voices. Identitarians are not fans of rich white guys like Paul and Scott, but these two at least stick to their expected role of adversary. They have much more contempt for identity traitors like Candace Owens.

On the top left are people who gleefully toss labels at their outgroup to reinforce [its homogeneity](#5) and overall wickedness. This usually serves to distance oneself from a label. On the bottom right, a person can attach a self-label to some conventional opinion to demonstrate how nicely predictable they are and to associate with a group.

These two corners are less of a committed stance and more of a tactical application of labels, but the same is true across the board – people change their willingness to label themselves and others depending on the situation. Labeling is a political tool; we should expect hypocrisy to be the norm rather than the exception.

<div id="21"> </div>

## Enlightenment

Before talking more about self-identifying, it’s worthwhile to consider why we even think that there is anything to identify  — a “self” that we can attach labels to. This is not a given; many people “…report no individualized sense of self, no self-related thoughts” This is from [a paper on Persistent Non-Symbolic Experiences](http://www.nonsymbolic.org/PNSE-Article.pdf), a sciencey-sounding term for what is normally called “enlightenment”.

Who’s “enlightened”? If you ask them, any and all of:
- An old monk wireheading in a cave, oblivious to suffering and desire.
- A rationalist [breaking through his default ontology](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tMhEv28KJYWsu6Wdo/kensh) to play with frameworks at will.
- Me, [after eating way too many mushrooms](https://putanumonit.com/2019/11/11/genesis/).

Whatever do these all have in common? Here’s my Predictable Identities conjecture: **the sense of self comes from habitual and repeated thoughts; novel thoughts make the self dissolve**.

“Habitual thoughts” means everything from high-level cogitation to low-level processing of stimuli. [Kaj Sotala points out](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mELQFMi9egPn5EAjK/my-attempt-to-explain-looking-insight-meditation-and) that something as simple as the perception of hearing a stick hitting a woodblock is the result of complicated processing that combines several auditory frequencies, your previous experience with wood objects, and mental imagery. This processing usually happens automatically: [hear sound] -> [imagine block]. 

But, with enough concentration, one can break this habit, leaving just the raw sounds to do with as one wishes. The same is true of “habits” like [feel pain] -> [experience suffering] or [see object of desire] -> [experience craving] that are the common focus of the monk’s meditation, or the frameworks of social interaction Valentine [writes about](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HnWN6v4wHQwmYQCLX/mythic-mode). 

When the part of your brain that monitors itself notices repeated patterns of thought it creates a high-level model called “self” that it can use for prediction. “I” am interpreting the sound as a stick hitting a woodblock. “I” suffer when in pain. “I” think of everything in terms of predictive processing. And “I” [will likely continue to do so](#18) in the future.

But when a thought or interpretation arises that can’t be predicted from the habits of my mind, there is no reason to assign it to a consistent thinking “self”. The thoughts I’m used to thinking are mine, but the novel ones could be anyone’s or no one’s.

## The Entropic Brain

Brain researcher Robert Carhart-Harris and physicist Karl Friston suggest that [psychedelics will save humanity](http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/71/3/316?fbclid=IwAR36UzFla5Lfx7-4LTr6R8N0XdUSOnbg3gnRPXn806cPKO7Zsas2EsJJhDs). They are, of course, far from the first people to do so. But they’re the first to explain how psychedelics will save humanity using the theory of predictive processing, which was developed in large part [by Friston himself](http://www.veo.io/images/817_1.pdf). And so with my interest sufficiently piqued, allow me to condense a decade of research on the [Entropic Brain Hypothesis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020/full#note14a) into a few paragraphs.

Our brains evolved to model the environment and minimize surprise and uncertainty. Since our environment is complex and dynamic, so are more evolved brains. fMRI allows us to measure brain entropy, how unpredictable is one’s brain state in the future based on its current state. It’s a proxy for a brain’s flexibility and complexity. 

Human brains are more entropic than those of our animal relatives, which in turn have more entropic brains than phylogenetically distant species. But humans have also developed a brain structure that suppresses entropy: the default mode network (DMN). According to Friston, optimal prediction is achieved when the brain is finely poised between order and disorder, rigidity and entropy. The DMN is less developed in children, and is suppressed in REM sleep, the onset of psychosis, and by psychedelics — all the above states are characterized by wandering thoughts, creativity, and magical thinking (hello, Ribbonfarm!) that isn’t strongly constrained by reason and prior experiences.

he DMN is also overactive in people with depression. This manifests in two features of depression: [“depressive realism”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=7872935) (a capacity to judge reality more accurately) and rigidity of thought (the mind is stuck in a negative bias that doesn’t respond to changes in the environment). In fact, many other mental disorders can be thought of as disorders of mental rigidity. For example: [addiction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0108-7) (the brain is stuck in loops of craving and indulgence), [autism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25347312?dopt=Abstract), [PTSD](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881112464827), and [schizophrenia](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6351/596?ijkey=0863d8e0058c07ad0af3795deecb3abdc08f2a33&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). Psychedelics increase brain entropy and “shake it out” of its rigid habits, allowing it to settle into more salubrious patterns (especially if guided by a good therapist).

There’s another effect that psychedelics cause by inhibiting the DMN — [the dissolution of ego and the sense of self](#21). Should we think of self-identity too as a disorder of mental rigidity? Stay tuned.

<div id="23"> </div>

## The Self

[In reality](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Democritus) there are only atoms and the void, but in our mind exists the self. This thing here is part of me, this thing there isn’t. The concept of self serves the same purpose as all others: it makes good predictions. Or perhaps it made good predictions at some point, [and got stuck](#22).

Self-identification gets off to a good start. A baby notices that when it wants the toy to move by itself the toy doesn’t budge, but when it wants its hand to move the hand immediately obliges. It begins to identify the body: that which is immediately moveable in the intended way by thought alone.

As a child grows, more and more things are reinforced by the world as part of its identity. This toy is yours, the other one isn’t: one can be grabbed with predictable good consequences, while grabbing the other one will trigger unpredictable retaliation. This essay was written by you and this is your grade for it, go back to your seat. The process is extended to one’s mind: the thoughts and feelings [you recognize in your mind](#21) are yours, and other people have their own.

It is at the level of thought that the model of the unified self starts to buckle under the strain of contradictions. Careful introspection reveals that your mind comprises [a multitude of independent subagents](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip) influencing your behavior and emotions in ways that your conscious self can’t access, let alone control. Careful study of societies reveals that our thoughts are shaped by memes, myths, and [egregores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore), cognitive processes that run in vast groups, not individuals. This post was written by my conscious model of the self, a mild anxiety in my stomach, [Alberto Albero](https://twitter.com/celestialboon/status/1208371376953942022), and Buddhism. In what sense is it mine?

Once we notice the breakdown of the rigid self as it relates to thought, we can see it in other contexts as well. Roles, blame and praise, personalities — these are merely conventions, as is private property. This even extends to the body: partnered dancers have as much control of their partner’s limbs as their own, while the most control you can exert over your appendix is chopping it off.

None of this means that drawing a circle around some things and calling them “myself” is always wrong. Just that there’s no clear “self” that matches reality in all contexts. This is good news, it means that the self is a thing to be played with.

<div id="24"> </div>

## Anti-Identity

Identity is [a set of habits of thought](#21). The very idea of identity is [just another habit you picked up](#23). The good news: once you realize that, you can build your own from scratch. The bad news: it will troll you.

Countless clichéd people want to be a writer and start cultivating that identity. They install Scrivener. They read research papers and inspiring novels. They plan how the book’s cover will look. They introduce themselves as a writer. They don’t write much.

There are many diagnoses of this common malaise. The predictable identities one is: adopting X as an identity makes you optimize for being predicted as X, rather than for X itself. If you tell people about the book you’re writing they’ll predict that you’re a writer and will treat you accordingly, reinforcing your identity. If you merely accumulate words in a draft file, they won’t.

If I hear someone identify as a “truth seeker” I know that they’re a devout Christian, devout skeptic, or both (i.e., Jordan Peterson). “Truth seekers” love public debates, they love researching arguments and counterarguments, they love talking about the importance of truth. What they rarely seem to do is [actually change their mind about anything](https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1217176202378649605) — the invisible action that doesn’t reinforce their “truth seeking” identity.

The first step to escaping [the trap of identity](#https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tAXrD8Y6hcJ8dt6Nt/the-curse-of-identity) is to build an identity of fluidity, corrigibility, and small verbs rather than big adjectives.  

- “Are you a writer?”  
- “I’ve been writing this blogchain.”   
- “Will you turn it into a book?”  
- “Probably not, but I may change my mind.” 
- “So you’re not really a writer.”
- “Never said I was.”

It’s hard to go overboard with an identity of breaking-habits and keeping the self small, since your natural inclination will always[pull you towards consistency](#18), and others [will assign labels to you](#20) whether you want to or not. Adopting an anti-identity can get you to a middle ground, and that’s a good place to start.

<div id="25"> </div>

## External Control

My psychiatrist friend deals with a richer slice of New Yorkers, and she describes a common pattern. Her clients recount an abusive relationship or job that is pushing them to the verge of suicide. But they can’t leave, it is the only thing more dreadful than staying. Sometimes they admit the true issue: if I’m not $$[X]$$, I don’t even know who I am.

Identities can control us. And other people can control our identities, grant them to us and withdraw them. My friend’s clients contemplate death, but the alternative is the death of the story they tell themselves.

[Esther Perel describes](https://putanumonit.com/2019/04/30/the-state-of-affairs/) how identity comes into play in relationships. Historically, marriage used to be about what you do (produce kids and/or feed and clothe them) or what you have (an alliance with the Habsburgs). But modern romance is about being loved for who you really are inside, not trivialities like what you bring to the table. This builds an identity of specialness: soulmate, the missing piece, the only one. As divorce and infidelity are becoming more common than ever they are also more painful, shattering one’s life story along with the relationship.

Not to be outdone by romance, companies also jumped on the identity-producing game. Jobs used to be described in terms of action: “glue together 170 widgets a day”. Now they describe a persona: “leader in the space” / “embodiment of our culture” / “inspiring team member”. You no longer merely work at BigCorpInc; you’re a [Googler, Postie, Amazonian](http://mikepope.com/blog/AddComment.aspx?blogid=2354).

But these manufactured articles lack the predictive power that imbues identities with potency. Can you tell much about a person from the fact that they’re a Microsoftie? But some identities have predictive associations that were accumulated over centuries. Those who grant and withhold them possess great power, ripe for abuse. 

Yes, we’re going to talk about academia.

<div id="26"> </div>

## Academic Identity

Why do smart kids go to grad school, to be underpaid and overworked for the prime years of their youth in a setting that [sextuples their chances of suffering from anxiety and depression?](https://www.benkuhn.net/grad/)

Scott Alexander posits that [academia is like a drug gang](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/28/non-dual-awareness/): the suffering is worth the 5-10% chance of becoming a tenured professor. Tenure is pretty great. You get paid six figures to converse with intellectual peers, [do research](https://putanumonit.com/2019/10/16/polyamory-is-rational/), and have your ideas read by an admiring public. But wait: I get paid six figures, chat with the best shitposters on Twitter during work hours, do research, and you’re reading my blogchain instead of an academic paper. Most people smart enough for a PhD can follow a similar path to corporate sinecure with a much more certain success rate than the academic lottery.

What I’m missing is the identity of an academic. An academic is an intellectual, a truth-seeker and truth-teller, a lifelong learner. Whereas I only do those things, if I feel like it.

An identity gives you permission to do all the above. External permission, such as being allowed in a laboratory if that’s where your interests are pursued. But it’s also about allowing yourself to engage in intellectual pursuits. Or even: being afraid that without the external pressure of people expecting (predicting) novel intellectual output from you, you would not create any.

[Consider this tweet](https://twitter.com/SnarkDivine/status/1229977838989783042):

![consider this tweet](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sassy-scientist-dark.png "consider this tweet")

Who would stay in a job that drives them to anxiety attacks and tearful breakdowns? Only someone who literally put “Scientist” in their name, who made that epithet more painful to lose than their mental health.

The dark irony of this all is: since your identity is in the hands of academic institutions, [they exert vast control](#25) over you. It could be benign, but it could include [demanding that someone betray](https://theotherlifenow.com/tag/jumping-ship/) their actual truth-seeking and truth-telling work if it goes against the institutions interests. The identity is not the thing; sometimes you must choose one over the other.
