## Abstract

Industrial development is the process by which economies learn how to produce new products and services.

- How do economies learn?

- And who do they learn from?

The literature on economic geography and economic development has emphasized two learning channels:

- inter-industry learning, which involves learning from related industries
- inter-regional learning, which involves learning from neighboring regions.

Data use:

- Data describing the evolution of China’s economy between 1990 and 2015–a period when China multiplied its GDP per capita by a factor of ten–to explore how Chinese provinces diversified their economies.

Findings:

- The probability that a province will develop a new industry increases with the number of related industries that are already present in that province, a fact that is suggestive of inter-industry learning.

- The probability that a province will develop an industry increases with the number of neighboring provinces that are developed in that industry, a fact suggestive of inter-regional learning.

- The combination of these two channels exhibit diminishing returns, meaning that the contribution of either of these learning channels is redundant when the other one is present.

## Introduction

## Data

## Conclusion and Discussions

Los encuentros del "abstract" fueron confirmados, pero las siguientes precauciones deben ser observadas:

- Las industrias que se utilizaron fueron las que tenian ventajas comparativas.

- Solo se consideraron las industrias presentes en la mercado de balores de Shanghai y Zhenzhen, lo cual es la minoria de las industrias en las provincias.

- En conclucion la data que se uso para el estudio tiene un sesgo hacia las grandes industrias.

Esperanzas para futuros estudios:

- We hope this paper helps stimulate the study of collective learning in economic development.

- Helps inspire new research to identify specific learning channels.
