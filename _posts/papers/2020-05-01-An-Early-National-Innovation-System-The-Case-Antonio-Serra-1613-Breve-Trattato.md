## Abstract

The idea that systemic relationships exist between different sectors of the economy that influence the production and implementation of new knowledge, and thus economic development is, however, much older than current research indicates.

Antonio Serra coherently presented the kernel of a national innovation system in 1613 Breve trattado, including two of its key elements increasing returns and synergies.

## Introduction – Mercantilism as a National System of Innovation

It has frequently been noted that static, barter-centred mainstream economics, as a collection of theoretical variants orbiting the neoclassical paradigm, is presently under siege
by a wider, more dynamic and socially embedded alternative that focuses on production and innovation as mechanisms of economic growth.

The purpose of this paper is to outline Antonio Serra’s theory of uneven economic development in the context of a national innovation systems approach to shed light on current policy concerns in the developing world. This also means putting Serra’s theory in its own historical context.

## Serra’s Causes of Economic Growth

There are, according to Serra, two main categories of factors affecting the economic development of a nation: the **natural** and the **accidental**.
Both are essentially ways of creating a **"surplus"**, either through the bounty of nature or the toil of man.

Sierra model (for the national wealth):

- quality of the industry
- the quality of the population
- the extension of trading operations
- the regulations of the sovereing

## Serra on Manufacturing Industry and Increasing Returns

 Manufactures, Serra argued, are unique because total costs decrease with increasing volumes of production.

Serra sees the multiplication of the division of labour in industries where a large market share—in form of ‘niches’.

The possibility of increasing returns was, throughout the entire mercantilist and Cameralist traditions, seen in connection with the increased opportunity for division of labour in manufactures, and therefore highly activity-specific.

 “No wonder Smith’s usage makes no distinction between commerce and industry. He assimilates the process of production to that of exchange”.

If one is to operate on the abstraction level in the works of Smith, Ricardo, and Samuelson’s trade theory, where production and exchange melt into the elusive concept of “labour time,” one loses an entire axis of value, namely the measurement of qualitative difference among economic activities (Reinert 1999.

## ‘Great Trade’ and the Theory of Cumulative Causation

 Export-led growth through import substituting industrialization has indeed been the basis of almost every  single successful industrialization policy from Solonic Athens to the Asian Tigers, a mandatory passage point of sorts on the road to the free market.
