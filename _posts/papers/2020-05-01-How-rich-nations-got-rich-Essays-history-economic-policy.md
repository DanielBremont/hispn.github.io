- get the institutions right
- get the governance right
- get the competitiveness right
- get the innovation system right
- get the economic activities right

## What did rich nations did to became rich?

The uniting element in the history of rich nations is estabilishing a critical mass of economic activities subject to increasing returns,
promote the mamufacturing sector, and state-building were for hunderds of years two sides of the same coin.

## The dabate of Mercantilism: A Brief Overview

- Midas falacy y el Mercantilismo.
- El origen de Estados Unidos, fueron origenes mercantilistas comenzando con Alexander Hamilton, 1791.
- Los mercantilistas pensaban que la produccion hacia a las naciones ricas y no las finanzas.

## Changing Mentality and the Origins of Renaissance Wealth Creation

- The undeniable urban bias of wealth creation was, at the time, identified as the result of 'synergic effects',  what Florentine chancelor Brunetto Latini(1210-1294) had called the 'common god'. 
- Neo-classical economics, with its focus on the allocation of scarce resources and equilibrium, in many ways, represents a return to scholasticism.
- A brief case-study of the Dutch city of Delft in the 17th century shows how synergies created by a diversified base of activities created knowledge and spillovers between seemingly unrelated activities
- Interconeccion de las actividades economicas.
- Nertherlands clusters : war(navy), luxury (art) and 'idle curiosity' (science) - in Holland at the time was mapmaking.
- The mercantilists revealed their conviction in common economic principles: 
	- Economic development is activity-specific, created by some economic activities (mamufacturing), rather than others. (Due to stagnat productivity, diminishing returns and monoculture, without synergies in agriculture).
	- Economic development is a synergic process: the greater the division of labour and the number of professions, the greater the wealth.
	- Starting in the 1700s, great emphasis wsa put on the beneficial synergies between manufacturing and agriculture: only where there was manufacturing, was there sucessful agriculture.

## Activity-Specific Growth and Context-Specific Policy

- Industrias y luego cultura.
- The establishment of an apprentice system in England under Elizabeth I cannot be understood outside the context of   highly successful Tudor strategy of building English woolen manufactures during the 1500s.
- These mercantilist institutions cannot be understood outside a context of nations seeking to escape a comparative advantage in producing raw materials.
- The Bretton  Woods institutions now defend the mercantilist institution that helps rich countries (i.e. patents), but seek to eliminate its twin institution that could help the poor (i.e. protection).

## Why Successful Mercantilism Carries the Seeds of its own Destruction, or Adam Smith, the Misunderstood Mercantilist

- From a ‘natural comparative advantage’ to a ‘created comparative advantage’
- Most mercantilists, and all the most sophisticated ones from Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683) to Friedrich List (1789-1846) and the 19th century American economists17, saw the end of industrial protection and, indeed, argued that international trade between nations specialized in manufactures was a positive-sum game.
- It is impossible to understand Friedrich List’s work without seeing that his ‘mercantilism’ was only a mandatory passage point towards free trade, which would be desirable when a symmetrical situation had been created in which all nations have a comparative advantage in dynamic, increasing return activities.
- Adam Smith can be read in a variety of ways, and he is an author who is more quoted than read.
- In his early work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (Smith 1759/1810), Adam Smith argued passionately for ‘the great system of government’ which is helped by adding new manufactures. Interestingly, Smith argued that new manufactures are to be promoted, neither to help suppliers nor to help consumers, but in order to improve ‘the great system of government’.

## Conclusion: Mercantilism as a Mandatory Passage Point for Development

- Even neoclassical economist will tell their children dot not become engeneer  but become a tomato saler.
- But they tell "become a tomato saler" to the developing contries.
- Mercantilism, probably the most contested ‘ism’ in the historiography of economic analysis (Magnusson 1994), is mostly summoned as a straw man of irrational folly representing a system of destructive rent-seekers that supposedly made the fundamental mistake of confusing gold with wealth.
- We argue that the basic mercantilist insights – in the right contexts – have been proved right, again and again.
	- national wealth cannot be created or based on raw material production in the absence of a manufacturing/increasing returns sector.
	- an inefficient manufacturing/increasing returns sector provides a much higher standard of living than no manufacturing sector.

# German Economics as Development Economics: From the Thirty Years War to World War II

- There were no graduate schools in economics in the United States in the 19th century, and most US economists received their Ph.Ds at German universities, as had all the founders of the American Economic Association. Reading knowledge of German was mandatory for economics PhDs in the United States until World War II.
- Karl Marx thinking was based on the german econonimical thinking based on production.

## Permanet Characteristics of the German Economic Tradition over Time

- German economics is above all an Erfahrungswissenschaft – a science based on experience.
- There is little metaphysical speculation and high abstractions, and many considered the economic theories of David Ricardo to be an example of such ‘metaphysical speculations’.
- Man’s near God-like quality of being able to create new things.

## Cameralist Economic Policy: From Veit von Seckendorff (1626-1692) to Wilhelm von Hörnigk (1640-1714)

- Early economic policy in Europe is frequently based on benchmarking against the successful states – the Netherlands (see essay in this paper) and Venice being the obvious cases – and against Spain, with its inflow of gold accompanied by deindustrialisation and increasing poverty, as the case to avoid.
- To Seckendorff, the Dutch appear as ‘examples of the wisest and in production and trade (in Gewerb) the most experienced people’ (Seckendorff, 1665). From the Netherlands, Seckendorff understood the crucial need for manufactures, and also the need to cluster economic activities, both arguments that Antonio Serra had already raised at a theoretical level in 1613.
- Philipp von Hörnigk ‘Nine Points of Economic Policy’:	
	- Hörnigk’s first point is ‘to inspect the country’s soil with the greatest care, and not to leave the agricultural possibilities of a single corner or clod of earth unconsidered. Every useful form of plant under the sun should be experimented with, to see whether it is adapted to the country’.
	- Second, ‘all commodities found in a country, which cannot be used in their natural state, should be worked up within the country; since the payment for manufacturing generally exceeds the value of the raw material by two, three, ten, twenty, and even a hundred fold’. Unemployment and underemployment represented huge problems at the time, and this ‘multiplier effect’ of manufacturing is commonly found, both as regards value added and as regards employment.
	- Third, ‘for carrying out the above two rules, there will be need of people, both for producing and cultivating the raw materials and for working them up (i.e. producing finished products). Therefore, attention should be given to the population, that it may be as large as the country can support, this being a well-ordered state’s most important concern, but, unfortunately, one that is often neglected. And the people should be turned by all possible means from idleness to remunerative professions; instructed and encouraged in all kinds of inventions, arts, and trades; and, if necessary, instructors should be brought in from foreign countries for this’.
	- Fourth, once in the country, gold and silver, ‘whether from its own mines or obtained by industry from foreign countries, are, under no circumstances to be taken out for any purpose, so far as possible, or be allowed to be buried in chests or coffers, but must always remain in circulation; nor should much be permitted in uses where they are at once destroyed and cannot be utilized again. For under these conditions, it will be impossible for a country that has once acquired a considerable supply of cash, especially one that possesses gold and silver mines, ever to sink into poverty; indeed, it is impossible that it should not continually increase in wealthy and property’. The emphasis on gold and silver was what mainstream history of thought had told us to expect, an emphasis supposedly exposing the ‘primitiveness’ of these theories. However, see Perrotta (1991) for an alternative view.
	- Therefore, Fifth, ‘the inhabitants of the country should make every effort to get along with their domestic products, to confine their luxury to these alone, and to do without foreign products as far as possible’. As Perrotta (1993) argues, import substitution was a key aspect of mercantilism. The first, and hugely successful, such import substitution strategy was the English ‘Tudor Plan’ from 1485-1603 (Reinert, 1995).
	- Sixth, ‘in case the said purchases were indispensable because of necessity or irremediable abuse, they should be obtained from these foreigners at first hand, so far as possible, and not for gold or silver, but in exchange for other domestic wares’.
	- Seventh, ‘such foreign commodities should in this case be imported in unfinished form, and worked up within the country, thus earning the wages of manufacturing there’. The multiplier mechanism of manufacturing applies both to the value added effect and the employment effect, and additionally solves the balance of payments problem.
	- Eight, ‘opportunities should be sought night and day for selling the country’s superfluous goods to these foreigners in manufactured form, so far as this is necessary, and for gold and silver; and to this end, consumption, so to speak, must be sought in the farthest ends of the earth, and developed in every possible way’. The ‘cult of export’ was not invented by the Washington Consensus. This is another way of improving balance of payment deficits endemic to poor countries, where Keynesian measures alone may only suck in imports.
	- Ninth, except for important considerations, no importation should be allowed under any circumstances of commodities of which there is a sufficient supply of suitable quality at home;  and in this matter neither sympathy nor compassion should be shown foreigners, be they friends, kinsfolk, allies, or enemies. For all friendship ceases, when it involves my own weakness and ruin. And this holds good, even if the domestic commodities are of poorer quality, or even higher priced. For it would be better to pay for an article two dollars which remain in the country than only one which goes out, however strange this may seem to the illinformed’. This sums up the value added, employment and balance of payment arguments, an argument also presentable in a neo-classical production possibility frontier type of analysis.


## The ‘Historical Schools’ of the 19th and 20th Centuries

- List’s vision of global free trade is desirable only after every nation has achieved a comparative advantage in increasing returns activities.

The policies of the mercantilists were based on the following understanding.
	- Economic development is activity-specific, created by some economic activities (manufacturing) rather than others (Due to agriculture’s stagnant productivity, diminishing returns and monoculture without synergies.)
	- Economic development is a synergetic process: the greater the division of labour and the number of professions, the greater the wealth (very clear already in Serra 1613).
	- The targeting, support, and protection of manufacturing is argued both in terms of
		a) its ability to create wealth,,
		b) its ability to create employment,
		c) its ability to solve balance of payment problems,
		d) its ability to increase the velocity of circulation of money.
	-  Starting in the 1700s great emphasis is put on the beneficial synergies between manufacturing and agriculture: only where there is manufacturing there is successful agriculture (Leibniz and Justi in Germany, Galiani in Italy, Hume in England).


#  This view would appear to run counter to the standard World Bank view that the lack of institutions per se can be blamed for the poor performance of so many Third World countries.

- This essay looks at the Dutch Republic from the vantage point of the economists of the period.
- Ther mercantilist economics believe that innovation produces grow.
- Mercantilism can productively be seen both as state- and nation-building (Schmoller 1897/1976) and as a strategy of industrial import substitution (Perrotta 1993), which at the time was seen as two sides of the same coin.

##  Engines of Growth: Generalising from the Experience of Early Economic Development in Venice and the Dutch Republic

- Friedrich Nietzsche called the most intelligent person of the 18th century – stated that ‘from manufacturing you may expect the two greatest ills of humanity, superstition and slavery, to be healed’ (Galiani 1770/1959: 116).

## Imperfect Competition, Schumpeterian Rents and Synergies in Early Economic Development

- Amintore Fanfani encapsulated the shift from scholasticism to mercantilism: ‘while scholasticism thinks of an order in equilibrium, mercantilism thinks of an order in growth’ (Fanfani 1955: 149)
- ‘So true it is, that when commerce has once changed its course, it is the most difficult thing in the World to bring it back again.’  (Path Dependency and Synergies)
