## Abstract

For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor.

As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them.

Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country’s economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country’s economy by characterizing the structure of this network.

Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country’s level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.

For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor.

As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them.

Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country’s economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country’s economy by characterizing the structure of this network.

Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country’s level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.

In this article we develop a method to characterize the structure of bipartite networks, which we call the **Method of Reflections**, and apply it to trade data to illustrate how it can be used to extract relevant information about the availability of capabilities in a country. We interpret the variables produced by the Method of Reflections as indicators of economic complexity and show that the complexity of a country’s economy is correlated with income and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth, suggesting that countries tend to approach the level of income associated with the capability set available in them.

We validate our measures of the capabilities available in a country by introducing a model and by showing empirically that our metrics are strongly correlated with the diversity of the labor inputs used in the production of a country’s goods, approximated by using data on the use of labor inputs in the United States. Finally, we show that the level of complexity of a country’s economy predicts the types of products that countries will be able to develop in the future, suggesting that the new products that a country develops depend substantially on the capabilities already available in that country.

## Methods

We look at country product associations by using international trade data with products disaggregated.

$$k_{c,0}$$ and $$k_{p,0}$$ represent, respectively, the observed levels of diversification of a country (the number of products exported by that country), and the ubiquity of a product (the number of countries exporting that product).
