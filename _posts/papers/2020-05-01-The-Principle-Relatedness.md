The network structure of economic output

Abstract

The idea that skills, technology, and knowledge, are spatially concentrated, has a long academic tradition. Yet, only recently this hypothesis has
been empirically formalized and corroborated at multiple spatial scales, for
different economic activities, and for a diversity of institutional regimes. The
new synthesis is an empirical principle describing the probability that a region
enters—or exits—an economic activity as a function of the number of related
activities present in that location. In this paper we summarize some of the recent
empirical evidence that has generalized the principle of relatedness to a fact
describing the entry and exit of products, industries, occupations, and technologies, at the national, regional, and metropolitan scales. We conclude by
describing some of the policy implications and future avenues of research
implied by this robust empirical principle.
