title: How to jump further and catch up? Path-breaking in an uneven industry space
categories: [papers]
---

Recent studies have argued that regional diversification emerges as a path-dependent process. Developed countries that industrialize do so first from core areas in an uneven industry space and have more opportunities to jump to new related industries and sustain economic growth than do developing countries that jump from peripheral areas. Can developing countries/regions jump further to break these path-dependent trajectories? Based on China’s export data, we show that regions can make such a jump by investing in extra-regional linkages and internal innovation. The effects of these two sets of variables vary across regions and industries.

# Introduction

- Generate collective efficiency and knowledge spillovers.
- Some scholars have re-examined their previous studies of regional development and its association with local knowledge spillovers, the cultivation of a local pool of specialized labor, local inter-firm synergies
and the division of labor, and institutional contexts, by employing ‘evolutionary’ metaphors, concepts and terminology.
- However, some recent empirical studies in evolutionary economic geography (EEG) have tended to overly focus on technological relatedness as a key explanatory factor for regional development.
- By emphasizing industrial relatedness, Hidalgo and Hausmann (2008) have directed our attention away from the one-dimensional, GDP-centered view of development where a region’s development is measured by its upward movement on a GDP ladder (or ramp) regardless of the products and services the region produces, toward a twodimensional network view of development. 
- According to the ‘network’ metaphor, regions are thought of as monkeys jumping among trees (i.e., industries)
- Monkeys can only jump onto trees within certain distance (i.e., relatedness between two industries)
- Hidalgo et al. (2007) have argued that developed countries that start from core areas densely populated with industries in the uneven industry space have more opportunities to diversify into new related industries and therefore have more possibility to sustain economic growth than do developing countries that jump from peripheral, deserted areas.
- Such a pessimistic, deterministic conclusion stems from an over-emphasis on technological relatedness, and has recently attracted several strands of criticism.

- **our focus is upon whether countries/regions, particularly developing ones, can jump further in the industry space and through what ways, and more importantly, what roles are played by extra-regional linkages, firm agency, institutions and policy making in developing regions/countries’ ‘catch-up’ stories.**

# Path dependence and path-breaking

- two types of new path creation.
  - The first one takes place when regions rely on technological relatedness among industries in order to develop into new industries.
  - technological discontinuities in which regions replace old, inferior technologies with new, superior technologies (Baum, 1996)

## Extra-regional linkages

- The standard canonical path dependence model portrays regional industrial evolution as a four-phase development:

  - path creation, where historical accidents initiate a new path and have significant long-run effects on the technological, industrial and institutional structure of a region;

    - path development, where emergence and development of local increasing returns and externalities assists the development of the path;

    - path rigidification, characterized by increasing rigidification of knowledge, networks and structures of firms and

    - path de-locking, where an exogenous shock disrupts or dislodges the regional economy resulting in an atrophy or industrial restructuring

- The idea that nurturing connections with distant actors may help prevent systematic industrial rigidification is also supported by Maskell and Malmberg (2007) who have argued that, from a micro-level perspective, localized learning and knowledge development often lead to overreliance on localized routines and over-embeddedness in existing structure, what Maskell and Malmberg called ‘spatial myopia’.

- By deliberately investing in building extra-regional linkages to distant communities, regions may be able to increase the variety of knowledge, resources and capabilities available to them and escape the potential limits stemming from their peripheral starting point in the industry space and the confinement of relatedness.

## Internal innovation

**In this article, we build on these insights to evaluate the relative roles of purposeful actions of actors within the region in shaping path-dependent processes as they inflect regional economic evolution through internal innovation.**

The more regions invest in internal innovations based on localized assets, the higher the capacity of regions to develop new industries that are less related to their existing productive structure **(Hypothesis 2)**.

# Research design

## Dependent variable and data

- A city has a comparative advantage in an industry when the share of this industry in the city’s total exports is larger than the share of this industry in the national total.

Our independent variable (xi,c,t1):
    - t1 (the first year in a study period)

Our dependent variable (xi,c,t2) is a dummy variable:
    - 1;  if city c has a comparative advantage in industry i in year t2, the last year of a study period
    - 0;  otherwise

These variables are computed using export data of Chinese firms during 2002–2011 compiled by the Chinese Customs Trade Statistics (CCTS).

## Independent variables

To investigate whether regions are able to break old pathways and diversify to less related industries, we need an indicator to measure technological relatedness between industries.

Two industries are considered to be related to each other if regions tend to have revealed comparative advantage ($$\text{RCA}$$) in both. The proximity ($$\psi$$) between industry $$i$$ and industry $$j$$ in year $$t$$ can be calculated as:

$$\psi_{i,j} = \text{min} \{P(\text{RCA}_{c,i} \gt 1 \| \text{RCA}_{c,j} \gt 1), P(\text{RCA}_{c,j} \gt 1 \| \text{RCA}_{c,i} \gt 1)\}$$ (1)

where

$$\text{RCA}_{c,i}  = \frac{\text{ExportValue}_{c,i} *\sum_{c,i} \text{ExportValue}_{c,i} } {\sum_{i} \text{ExportValue}_{c,i}* \sum_c{\text{ExportValue}_{c,i}} }$$(2)

$$\text{RCA}_{c,i}$$ is the $$\text{RCA}$$ of industry $$\text{i}$$ in city $$\text{c}$$.

City $$c$$ is considered as having a comparative advantage in industry $$i$$, if $$\text{RCA}_{c,i}$$ is above $$1$$.

# Discussion and conclusion

Although traditional economic geography literature has attributed regional development to a wide range of factors, empirical EEG studies tend to overly focus on technological relatedness as a key driving force, and emphasize that regions often branch into industries that are technologically related to their preexisting industrial structure. Such a path-dependent regional diversification can be thought of as regions/ countries jumping in a heterogeneous and uneven industry space where they are only allowed to jump certain distance. This distance is determined by technological relatedness among industries.

Empirically, this research seeks to find a brighter future for developing countries/regions in an increasingly competitive global economy by pointing out that the seemingly dominant path-dependent development trajectories can be broken through continuously improving infrastructure and education, providing government supports, investing in R&D and fostering an open-minded social and institutional context. In doing so, less developed regions may be able to catch up and jump from peripheral areas further into core areas in the uneven industry space.
