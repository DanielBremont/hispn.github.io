## Abstract

My work in economics involves constructing theoretical models.

The economic models that I create are idealizatino of reality.
But there is probably enough connection with reality to make the description useful—which I hope is also true for my economic models.

## Getting ideas

The first step is to get a good idea. The way you do this is to come up with lots and lots of ideas and throw out all the ones that aren’t good.

I think that you should look for your ideas outside the academic journals—in newspapers, in magazines, in conversations, and in TV and radio programs. When you read the newspaper, look for the articles about economics . . . and then look at the ones that aren’t about economics, because lots of the time they end up being about economics too. Magazines are usually better than newspapers because they go into issues in more depth. On the other hand, a shallower analysis may be more stimulating: there’s nothing like a fallacious argument to stimulate research.

Conversations, especially with people in business, are often very fruitful.

## Is your idea worth pursuing

Try to phrase your idea in a way that a non-economist can understand.

See if your model is interesting.

## Don’t look at the literature too soon

- First, you need the practice of developing a model. Even if you end up reproducing exactly something that is in the literature already you will have learned a lot by doing it—and you can feel awfully good about yourself for developing a publishable idea.

- Second, you might come up with a different approach than is found in the literature.

## Building your model

Lucky for you, all economics models look pretty much the same. There are some economic agents. They make choices in order to advance their objectives. The choices have to satisfy various constraints so there’s something that adjusts to make all these choices consistent.

This basic structure suggests a plan of attack: Who are the people making the choices? What are the constraints they face? How do they interact? What adjusts if the choices aren’t mutually consistent?

## Generalizing your model

## Making mistakes

This process—simplify to get the result, complexify to see how general it is—is a good way to understand your model. Most of the time that I spend modeling is involved in this back-and-forth process. Along the way, I make a lot of mistakes. As Piet Hein puts it:

- The road to wisdom? Well it’s plain
- and simple to express:
- Err
- and err
- and err again
- but less
- and less
- and less

## Searching the literature

An interesting learning part, if someone was come out with a better ask yourself? Why didn't I do That? Se was you missed?

## Giving a seminar

## Planning your paper

## The structure of the paper

## When to stop

## Writing textbooks

## Summary

- Look for ideas in the world, not in the journals.

- First make your model as simple as possible, then generalize it.

- Look at the literature later, not sooner.

- Model your paper after your seminar.

- Stop when you’ve made your point.
