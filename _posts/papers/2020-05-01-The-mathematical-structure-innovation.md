Abstract

Despite our familiarity with specific technologies, the origin of new
technologies remains mysterious. Are new technologies made from
scratch, or are they built up recursively from new combinations of
existing technologies? To answer this, we introduce a simple model
of recursive innovation in which technologies are made up of components and combinations of components can be turned into new
componentsâ€”a process we call technological recursion. We derive a
formula for the extent to which technological recursion increases or
decreases the likelihood of making new technologies. We test our predictions on historical data from three domains and find that technologies are not built up from scratch, but are the result of new combinations of existing technologies. This suggests a dynamical process by
which known technologies were made and a strategy for accelerating
the discovery of new ones.
