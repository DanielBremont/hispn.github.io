Smart Specialization: theory and brief case studies

Abstract

The ‘Smart specialization’ (SS) project of the European Union is both an
innovative project and an ongoing experiment on industrial and innovation
policy, probably the biggest such experiment globally.1
This approach makes it possible to rediscover mechanisms that have been extremely
successful creating wealth in the past, and may contribute importantly to
the eradication of poverty also in the future. An important aspect of this
project is that it emphasizes the importance of solving the problems of
relative poverty and backwardness by interfering in the productive sector
of the relatively poor areas, not by transfer of purchasing power from
other and richer geographical areas. Rather than alleviating the symptoms
of poverty through transfers (focusing on the poor as consumers), the
Smart Specialization approach attacks the causes of poverty in the realm
of production (focusing on the poor as producers). This reflects the
original intention from Maastricht that the European Union should avoid
becoming a ‘transfer union’. In the end, in the opinion of this author, a
better understanding of smart and less smart specialization would also
bring us closer to comprehend the uneven financial flows within the European Union, often originating in the productive sector.
