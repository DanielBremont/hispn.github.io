How rich nations got rich. Essays in the history of economic policy

Abstract

The debate around the effects of globalization is both widening and deepening. While some
nations, like India and China – countries that have consciously built a manufacturing sector for
five decades – come across as winners, a large number of smaller Third World nations seem to
lose out under globalisation. The problem of failing and failed states is growing. In response to
the increasing challenges, the focal points of the Washington Institutions – the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – have changed over the last 15 years, reflecting a
growing recognition of the complexities of economic development. The initial phase, after the
fall of the Berlin Wall, can be described as ‘get the prices right’, and development will more or
less take care of itself. In this phase states and government policies were out, supposedly
harmony-creating markets were in. A second phase can be described as ‘get the property rights
right’. It was understood that the market needed a legal setting. A third stage of understanding
was reached in the mid-1990s when the watchword became ‘get the institutions right’, followed
by ‘get the governance right’. Towards the end of the 1990s, evolutionary or neoSchumpeterian elements were added to this moving target of prescriptions: ‘get the
competitiveness right’ and ‘get the innovation system right’.
