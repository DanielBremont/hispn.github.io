Learning Curves in Manufacturing

Abstract

Large increases in productivity are typically realized as
organizations gain experience in production. These
"learning curves" have been found in many organizations.
Organizations vary considerably in the rates at which they
learn. Some organizations show remarkable productivity
gains, whereas others show little or no learning. Reasons
for the variation observed in organizational learning
curves include organizational "forgetting," employee
turnover, transfer of knowledge from other products and
other organizations, and economies of scale.
