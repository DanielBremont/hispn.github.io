Trade, Accumulation, and Uneven Development

Abstract

This paper develops a two-country model of capital accumulation and growth where the
industrial sector exhibits increasing returns to scale. It shows that ‘uneven development’ IS a
necessary outcome in such a model: an initial discrepancy in capital-!abor ratios between the
two countries will cumulate over time, leading to the division of the world into a capital-rich.
industrial region and capital-poor, agricultural region. Which region take?; on which role
depends on ‘primitive accumulation’; that is, on which region starts with more capital. If capital
is mobile internattonally. the model can given rise to a two-stage pattern of development a
first stage where trade is the engine of growth in the leading country. and a second in which
foreign investment takes on that role -- w;:i~h is reminiscent of the HohsonLenin theory of
imperialism.
