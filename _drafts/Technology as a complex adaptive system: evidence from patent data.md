Technology as a complex adaptive system: evidence from patent data

Abstract

This paper develops a theory of invention by drawing on complex adaptive systems theory. We see invention as a process of
recombinant search over technology landscapes. This framing suggests that inventors might face a ‘complexity catastrophe’
when they attempt to combine highly interdependent technologies. Our empirical analysis of patent citation rates supports
this expectation. Our results also suggest, however, that the process of invention differs in important ways from biological
evolution. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on technological evolution, industrial change, and
technology strategy. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
