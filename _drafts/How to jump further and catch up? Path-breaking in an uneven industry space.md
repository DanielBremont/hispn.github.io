How to jump further and catch up? Path-breaking in an uneven industry space

Abstract

Recent studies have argued that regional diversification emerges as a path-dependent process. 
Developed countries that industrialize do so first from core areas in an uneven
industry space and have more opportunities to jump to new related industries and
sustain economic growth than do developing countries that jump from peripheral
areas. Can developing countries/regions jump further to break these path-dependent
trajectories? Based on Chinaâ€™s export data, we show that regions can make such a
jump by investing in extra-regional linkages and internal innovation. The effects of
these two sets of variables vary across regions and industries.
