The Geography of Complex Knowledge

Abstract

There is consensus among scholars and policy makers
that knowledge is one of the key drivers of long-run
economic growth. It is also clear from the literature
that not all knowledge has the same value. However,
too often in economic geography and cognate fields
we have been obsessed with counting knowledge
inputs and outputs rather than assessing the quality
of knowledge produced. In this article we measure the
complexity of knowledge, we map the distribution
and the evolution of knowledge complexity in US
cities, and we explore how the spatial diffusion of
knowledge is linked to complexity. Our knowledge
complexity index rests on the bimodal network models of Hidalgo and Hausmann. Analysis is based on
more than two million patent records from the US
Patent and Trademark Office that identify the technological structure of US metropolitan areas in terms of
the patent classes in which they are most active
between 1975 and 2010. We find that knowledge
complexity is unevenly distributed across the United
States and that cities with the most complex technological structures are not necessarily those with the
highest rates of patenting. Citation data indicate that
more complex patents are less likely to be cited than
less complex patents when citing and cited patents are
located in different metropolitan areas.
