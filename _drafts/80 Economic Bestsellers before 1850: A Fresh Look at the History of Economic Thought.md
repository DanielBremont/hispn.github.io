80 Economic Bestsellers before 1850: A Fresh Look at the History of Economic Thought

Abstract

The core and backbone of this publication consists of the meticulous work of Kenneth Carpenter, librarian of the Kress Library at Harvard Business School starting in 1968 and later Assistant Director for Research Resources in the Harvard University Library and the Harvard College Library.1 We can now only imagine the incredible efforts required to produce the first version of the bestseller list, covering 40 titles, in 1975. Painstakingly assembling bibliographies of elusive and rare titles before the internet was made possible through Carpenterâ€™s extensive correspondence, over decades, with the major research libraries of the world, and through his visits to many libraries.
