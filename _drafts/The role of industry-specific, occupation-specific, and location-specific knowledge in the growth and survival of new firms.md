The role of industry-specific, occupation-specific, and location-specific knowledge in the growth and survival of new firms

Abstract

How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify
their economic activities? How does the migration of workers
among firms and industries contribute to the diffusion of that
knowledge? Here we measure the industry-, occupation-, and
location-specific knowledge carried by workers from one establishment to the next, using a dataset summarizing the individual
work history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms—firms
operating in an industry that was not present in a region—
because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional
economic diversification. We find that the growth and survival of
pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are workers
with experience in a related industry and with work experience
in the same location, but not with past experience in a related
occupation. We compare these results with new firms that are
not pioneers and find that industry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than for nonpioneer firms.
To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks
for local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry-specific knowledge is a predictor of
the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand
our understanding of the micromechanisms underlying regional
economic diversification.
