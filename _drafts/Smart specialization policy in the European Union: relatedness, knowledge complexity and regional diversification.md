Smart specialization policy in the European Union: relatedness, knowledge complexity and regional diversification

Abstract

The operationalization of smart specialization policy has been rather limited because a coherent set of analytical tools to
guide the policy directives remains elusive. We propose a policy framework around the concepts of relatedness and
knowledge complexity. We show that diversifying into more complex technologies is attractive but difficult for European
Union regions to accomplish. Regions can overcome this diversification dilemma by developing new complex
technologies that build on local related capabilities. We use these findings to construct a policy framework for smart
specialization that highlights the potential risks and rewards for regions of adopting competing diversification strategies.
