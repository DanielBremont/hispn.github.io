An Early National Innovation System: The Case of Antonio Serra’s 1613 Breve Trattato

Abstract

Based on the economics of Joseph Schumpeter, National Innovation Systems have
since the early 1990’s emerged as a holistic and socioculturally embedded alternative
approach to explaining economic growth. The idea that systemic relationships exist between
different sectors of the economy that influence the production and implementation of new
knowledge, and thus economic development is, however, much older than current research
indicates. We will argue the Neapolitan mercantilist Antonio Serra coherently presented the
kernel of a national innovation system already in his 1613 Breve trattato, including two of its
key elements increasing returns and synergies. The problems of establishing the institutions
conducive to economic growth faced by mercantilists at the end of the Renaissance are shared
today by policy-makers in the developing world, and it can therefore prove to be fruitful, if
not necessary, to explore the historical roots of this early innovation system approach. Indeed,
Serra’s work has been brought back to light on several occasions in the past centuries, each
time as a source of guidance in an era of economic turmoil: first on the eve of Italian
unification, then at the dawn of German industrialization. Following the failure of the Cancun
meetings in 2003 to reach a trade agreement between North and South, such turmoil is over us
again as it becomes increasingly clear that the reigning economic dogma has failed to deliver
on its political promises. We argue that, in the economic profession’s inevitable search for
new means and methods, Serra’s message is again relevant.
